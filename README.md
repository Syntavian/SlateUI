# SlateUI

SlateUI is simple web application styling framework with the goal of speeding up development of apps with vanilla HTML, JS, & CSS.

SlateUI is built with Sass to produce a large library of prebuilt styles you can apply to your HTML, and the build tool will build the styles you use into a minified CSS file to minimise the final app size.
